Historically, when handling security, staff first check whether refund_amount >= 400, and outcomes tend to be verify_identity.

As a rule of thumb in privacy, unless special circumstances apply, the path often ends with disclose_pii after confirming contains_pii == True.

In most cases, teams treat security requests as valid only when refund_amount >= 400; this usually leads to verify_identity.

In most cases, teams treat refund requests as valid only when has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 14; this usually leads to offer_refund.
