Policy POL-PRIVACY-016 (regulatory priority) states that if data contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii equals True), then agents must disclose the presence of personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

**Privacy Handling Policy (POL-PRIVACY-016)**

Under Policy POL-SHIP-013, designated as company priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when the item is in stock (item_in_stock == True); however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True).

Under Policy POL-SHIP-018, designated as department priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when the item is in stock (item_in_stock == True); however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True).

When handling privacy matters, teams have typically found that once they've confirmed personal information is present in the data, the natural next step has usually been to proceed with disclosure. This has generally been the way things flow in most standard situations, though of course there are always those occasional exceptions that might call for a different approach.

When handling privacy requests, here's the deal: if `contains_pii == True`, teams must treat the request as valid, which triggers `disclose_pii`. Think of it like a green light—PII detected means the request gets processed and information gets shared.
