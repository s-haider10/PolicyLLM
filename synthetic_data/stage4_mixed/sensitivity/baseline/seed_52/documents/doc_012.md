When a refund request is submitted with a refund_amount greater than or equal to 400, agents must perform verify_identity before processing the refund, as specified under Policy POL-SEC-007 (situational priority).

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-005 (company priority), agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 14 days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if the item shows physical damage (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-005, designated as company priority, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within fourteen days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), the standard behavior established by POL-REFUND-005 shall be overridden.

When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Policy POL-SEC-002 (department priority) mandates that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-002 shall be overridden.
