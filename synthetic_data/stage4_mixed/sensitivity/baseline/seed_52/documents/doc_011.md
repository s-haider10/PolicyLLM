When customers have come to us with returns over the years, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they bring their receipt along. Usually, if someone's within about four weeks of their purchase and has that proof of purchase handy, the conversation naturally tends to wrap up with us offering them their money back. That's just how these situations have generally played out, barring anything unusual coming up.

When handling refund requests, we've typically found that things go smoothest when customers can show their receipt and they're coming to us within about four weeks of buying the item. In those situations, the conversation usually wraps up with us being able to offer them their money back. Of course, there are always those unique cases that might need a different approach, but that's generally how these interactions have played out.

When customers have come to us looking for refunds, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they've held onto their receipt and are reaching out within a couple weeks of buying. In those cases, our team has usually wrapped things up by extending a refund offer to them. Of course, every now and then something unusual comes up that might change how we handle things.

When it comes to getting orders out the door, the team typically takes a look at what's actually available in the warehouse first. If everything checks out and the item is on hand, things usually move pretty quickly from there – most packages tend to head out within a couple of days.
