Under Policy POL-RETURNS-014 (department priority), agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 21 days (days_since_purchase <= 21); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.

Under Policy POL-SHIP-018, designated as department priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when the item is in stock (item_in_stock == True); however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True).

Policy POL-SHIP-018 (department priority) stipulates that when item_in_stock == True, agents must ship_within_48h; however, if severe_weather_alert == True, then allow_delay is permitted as an exception to the standard shipping timeframe. As a low-priority department exception, when item_in_stock == False, standard behavior for POL-SHIP-018 shall be overridden.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-006 (department priority) mandates that agents must disclose personally identifiable information (PII) when the condition contains_pii equals True.
