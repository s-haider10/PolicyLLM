Historically, when handling security, staff first check whether refund_amount >= 400, and outcomes tend to be verify_identity.

In most cases, teams treat refund requests as valid only when has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 28; this usually leads to offer_refund.

Historically, when handling shipping, staff first check whether item_in_stock == True, and outcomes tend to be ship_within_48h.

As a rule of thumb in refund, unless special circumstances apply, the path often ends with offer_refund after confirming has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 7.
