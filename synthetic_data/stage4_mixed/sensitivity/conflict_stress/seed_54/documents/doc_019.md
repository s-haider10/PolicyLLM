Historically, when handling returns, staff first check whether has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 28, and outcomes tend to be offer_refund.

As a rule of thumb in security, unless special circumstances apply, the path often ends with verify_identity after confirming refund_amount >= 400.

Historically, when handling shipping, staff first check whether item_in_stock == True, and outcomes tend to be ship_within_48h.

In most cases, teams treat shipping requests as valid only when item_in_stock == True; this usually leads to ship_within_48h.
