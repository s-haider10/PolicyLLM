Policy POL-REFUND-020 (regulatory priority). If has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 7, agents must offer_refund. Exception: if physical_damage == True, then deny_refund.

Low-priority department exception: if has_receipt == False, override standard behavior for POL-REFUND-020.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-011 (situational priority). If contains_pii == True, agents must disclose_pii.

As a rule of thumb in shipping, unless special circumstances apply, the path often ends with ship_within_48h after confirming item_in_stock == True.

Policy POL-SHIP-018 (department priority). If item_in_stock == True, agents must ship_within_48h. Exception: if severe_weather_alert == True, then allow_delay.
