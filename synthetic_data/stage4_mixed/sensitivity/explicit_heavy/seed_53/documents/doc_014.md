Historically, teams have typically processed shipping requests when inventory showed items were available. In those situations, orders usually went out within a couple of days.

**Shipping Fulfillment Policy**

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), a delay in shipping is permitted (allow_delay).

Under Policy POL-REFUND-015, designated as situational priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt equals True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage equals True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

When processing a refund request, staff must verify that the customer has a valid receipt (has_receipt == True) and that the purchase was made within the last 28 days (days_since_purchase <= 28). If both conditions are met, proceed with offer_refund.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, which operates as a situational priority policy, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.
