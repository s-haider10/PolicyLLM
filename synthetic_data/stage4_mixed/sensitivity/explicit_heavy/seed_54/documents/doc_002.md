Policy POL-SHIP-018 (department priority) stipulates that when item_in_stock equals True, agents must ship_within_48h; however, an exception applies whereby if severe_weather_alert equals True, then allow_delay is permitted.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-015, designated as situational priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-011 shall be applied on a situational priority basis and stipulates that when the condition contains_pii is equal to True, agents must execute the action disclose_pii.
