Under Policy POL-RETURNS-004, designated as regulatory priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within seven days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 7); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

Looking back at how teams have handled these situations, security requests have typically been considered legitimate when the refund amount reaches at least 400 or higher. When that threshold is met, the natural next step has usually been to verify the person's identity before moving forward.

**Security Verification Policy**

When customers come in asking about refunds, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they bring their receipt along and it's been within about a week of their purchase. In those situations, staff have usually just gone ahead and processed the refund for them without much fuss.

Agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt and the number of days since purchase is less than or equal to 14; however, if physical damage is present, agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.
