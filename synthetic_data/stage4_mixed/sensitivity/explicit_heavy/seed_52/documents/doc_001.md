# Stage 4 (hybrid) synthetic document 1

When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the customer's identity, as established under Policy POL-SEC-017 and designated as a company priority.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-016 (regulatory priority) states that when data contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii equals True), agents are required to disclose the presence of personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

**Privacy Handling Policy (POL-PRIVACY-016)**

When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the identity of the customer, as established under Policy POL-SEC-012 with regulatory priority classification.

When handling security matters, you'll want to follow this general guideline: after you've confirmed the refund amount hits $400 or above, make sure the process wraps up with verify_identity - that's your standard endpoint unless something unusual comes up.
