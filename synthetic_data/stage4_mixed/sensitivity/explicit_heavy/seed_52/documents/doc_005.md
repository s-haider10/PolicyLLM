When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the identity of the customer, as established under Policy POL-SEC-012 with regulatory priority classification.

Policy POL-SEC-012 (regulatory priority) mandates that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-012 shall be overridden.

Under Policy POL-SHIP-018, designated as department priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when item_in_stock equals True; however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when severe_weather_alert equals True.

When processing refund requests under Policy POL-REFUND-005 (company priority), agents must offer a refund to the customer if has_receipt equals True and days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 14 days; however, if physical_damage equals True, agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, which is designated as situational priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if the item exhibits physical damage (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or time since purchase.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, designated as situational priority, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), standard behavior for Policy POL-RETURNS-019 shall be overridden.
