As a rule of thumb in shipping, unless special circumstances apply, the path often ends with ship_within_48h after confirming item_in_stock == True.

In most cases, teams treat shipping requests as valid only when item_in_stock == True; this usually leads to ship_within_48h.

In most cases, teams treat refund requests as valid only when has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 7; this usually leads to offer_refund.

Historically, when handling security, staff first check whether refund_amount >= 400, and outcomes tend to be verify_identity.
