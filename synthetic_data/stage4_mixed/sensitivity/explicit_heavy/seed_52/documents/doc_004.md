When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Under Policy POL-SHIP-013, designated as company priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when the item is in stock (item_in_stock == True); however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when a severe weather alert is in effect (severe_weather_alert == True).

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, which operates as a situational priority policy, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.
