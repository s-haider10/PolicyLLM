Policy POL-PRIVACY-006 establishes a department priority requirement whereby agents must disclose personally identifiable information (PII) when the condition contains_pii equals True.

When a refund request is submitted with a refund_amount greater than or equal to 400, agents must perform verify_identity before processing the refund, as specified under Policy POL-SEC-007 (situational priority).

Under Policy POL-REFUND-005 (company priority), agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 14 days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the customer's identity, as established under Policy POL-SEC-017 and designated as a company priority.
