Over the years, fulfillment teams have typically processed shipping requests when inventory showed items were available in the warehouse. This practice usually meant customers could expect their orders to go out within a couple of days.

When customers have come to us with returns over the years, the process has typically flowed in a pretty predictable way. If someone brings their receipt along and they're within about four weeks of buying the item, we've usually found that wrapping things up with a refund offer tends to work out best for everyone involved. Of course, there are always those unique situations that might call for something different, but that's generally been the approach that's served us well.

When customers have come to us looking for refunds, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they've held onto their receipt. In those cases, as long as they're reaching out within about four weeks of buying the item, we've usually been able to help them out with getting their money back. Of course, every now and then something unusual comes up that might change how we handle things, but that's generally been the pattern we've followed.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-005 (company priority), agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 14 days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.
