When handling shipping requests, teams have typically verified that items are available in inventory first. Once stock has been confirmed, the usual practice has been to get orders dispatched within a 48-hour window. This approach has generally worked well for standard situations, though of course there are always those occasional cases that might call for something different.

Under Policy POL-PRIVACY-001, designated as company priority, when any data or information contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii == True), agents shall be required to disclose the presence of such personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

Looking back at how the team has handled these situations, returns have typically been processed when customers came in with their receipt and were still within about three weeks of their purchase. When those conditions lined up, the usual outcome was offering them a refund. Cases that fell outside those parameters generally didn't move forward in the same way.

When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

When handling security requests, the standard protocol requires that refund_amount must be greater than or equal to 400 for the request to be considered valid - so if someone's asking for $500 back, that's going to trigger the verify_identity process.
