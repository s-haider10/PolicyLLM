Under Policy POL-SHIP-018, designated as department priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when item_in_stock equals True; however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when severe_weather_alert equals True.

Policy POL-SHIP-018 (department priority) establishes that when item_in_stock == True, agents must ship_within_48h; however, if severe_weather_alert == True, then allow_delay is permitted as an exception to the 48-hour shipping requirement. As a low-priority department exception, when item_in_stock == False, standard behavior for POL-SHIP-018 shall be overridden.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-020, which holds regulatory priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within seven days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 7); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase timeframe.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), a delay in shipping is permitted (allow_delay).
