When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the customer's identity, as established under Policy POL-SEC-017 and designated as a company priority.

Policy POL-SEC-017 (company priority) mandates that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-017 shall be overridden.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-010, designated as department priority, agents shall offer a refund to customers when the customer has a valid receipt (has_receipt equals True) and the purchase was made within twenty-one days or fewer (days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 21); however, notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, agents shall deny the refund if the item exhibits physical damage (physical_damage equals True).

Under Policy POL-REFUND-010, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 21 days (days_since_purchase <= 21); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception to this policy, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), standard Policy POL-REFUND-010 behavior shall be overridden.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-011 shall be applied on a situational priority basis and stipulates that when the condition contains_pii is equal to True, agents must execute the action disclose_pii.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-011 (situational priority) shall govern the handling of personally identifiable information as follows: when contains_pii equals True, agents must execute disclose_pii; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby when contains_pii equals False, standard behavior for POL-PRIVACY-011 shall be overridden.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, which operates as a situational priority policy, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), standard Policy POL-RETURNS-019 behavior shall be overridden.
