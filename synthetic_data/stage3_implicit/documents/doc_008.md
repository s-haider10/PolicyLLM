When customers come back with items they'd like to return, the team typically looks for their proof of purchase first and considers how recently the transaction took place. Usually, if someone has held onto their receipt and it's been about four weeks or less since they bought the item, things tend to work out in their favor with their money being returned to them.

When it comes to getting orders out the door, the team typically takes a look at what's actually available in the warehouse first. If everything checks out and the item is on hand, things usually move pretty quickly from there – most packages tend to head out within a couple of days.

When customers have come to us looking for refunds, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they've held onto their receipt and are coming back within a couple weeks of their purchase. In those situations, our team has usually wrapped things up by extending a refund offer to them. Of course, there are always those unique cases that call for a different approach, but that's generally been how these conversations tend to play out.

When handling shipping requests, the process has typically followed a familiar pattern over time. Teams have usually verified that items are available in inventory first, and once that's been confirmed, orders have generally moved forward to be dispatched within a couple of days. This has just been how things naturally tend to flow in most standard situations.
