Over the years, customer service teams have typically handled refund situations by looking at a couple of key factors.

That's just how these requests have generally been processed around here.

When customers have come to us looking for refunds, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they've held onto their receipt. In those cases, as long as they're reaching out within about four weeks of buying the item, we've usually been able to work something out for them and get that refund processed. Of course, every now and then there are situations that call for a different approach, but that's generally been how these conversations tend to wrap up.
