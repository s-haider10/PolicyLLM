When handling shipping requests, the process has typically followed a familiar pattern over time. Teams have usually verified that items are available in inventory first, and once stock has been confirmed, orders have generally moved forward to ship within a 48-hour window. This has been the natural flow that most fulfillment processes have settled into, barring any unusual situations that might call for a different approach.

When customers have come to us with returns over the years, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they bring their receipt along. Usually, if someone's within that two-week window from when they bought the item, the conversation naturally tends to wrap up with us offering them their money back. Of course, there are always those unique situations that might call for something different, but that's generally been how these interactions have played out.

When customers have come to us looking for refunds, we've typically found that things go smoothest when they've held onto their receipt and are reaching out within a couple weeks of buying. In those situations, our team has usually wrapped things up by extending a refund offer to them. Of course, there are always those unique cases that call for a different approach.

When customers come back with items they'd like to return, the team typically looks for their receipt first and considers how recently the purchase was made. If someone has their proof of purchase and it's been within about four weeks or so, staff usually find themselves processing a refund for them. That's just how these situations have tended to work out over time.
