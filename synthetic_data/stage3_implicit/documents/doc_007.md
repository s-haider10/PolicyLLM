Historically, when handling security, staff first check whether refund_amount >= 400, and outcomes tend to be verify_identity.

Historically, when handling returns, staff first check whether has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 21, and outcomes tend to be offer_refund.

As a rule of thumb in refund, unless special circumstances apply, the path often ends with offer_refund after confirming has_receipt == True and days_since_purchase <= 7.

Historically, when handling privacy, staff first check whether contains_pii == True, and outcomes tend to be disclose_pii.
