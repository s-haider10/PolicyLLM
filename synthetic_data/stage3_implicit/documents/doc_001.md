Looking back at how the team has handled these situations, returns typically get processed smoothly when customers bring in their receipt and come back within about three weeks of buying something. That's usually when we'd go ahead and offer them their money back. Without that proof of purchase or if too much time has passed beyond that three-week window, things tend to go differently.

When security matters come up, staff have typically started by looking at whether the refund amount is at least 400. In those situations, the usual practice has been to verify the person's identity before moving forward.

Historically, teams have typically processed shipping requests when inventory showed items were available, which usually meant getting orders out the door within a couple of days.

Usually, they'll want to see if the customer brought their receipt along, and they tend to check how recently the purchase was made – generally within about a week or so. When those pieces line up, the usual practice has been to go ahead and offer the customer their money back.
