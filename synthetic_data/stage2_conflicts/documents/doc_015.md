When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Policy POL-SEC-002 (department priority) mandates that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-002 shall be overridden.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), a delay in shipping is permitted (allow_delay).

Under Policy POL-REFUND-010, designated as department priority, agents shall offer a refund to customers when the customer has a valid receipt (has_receipt equals True) and the purchase was made within twenty-one days or fewer (days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 21); however, notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, agents shall deny the refund if the item exhibits physical damage (physical_damage equals True).

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-019, which operates as a situational priority policy, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 28 days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 28); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or time since purchase.
