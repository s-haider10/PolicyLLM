# Stage 2 synthetic document 9

When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the identity of the customer, as established under Policy POL-SEC-012 with regulatory priority classification.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-014 (department priority), agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 21 days (days_since_purchase <= 21); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Policy POL-SEC-002 (department priority) establishes that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-002 shall be overridden.

Under Policy POL-PRIVACY-016, which is designated as regulatory priority, when data contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii equals True), agents shall be required to disclose the presence of such personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

Policy POL-PRIVACY-016 (regulatory priority) states that if contains_pii equals True, agents must execute disclose_pii; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if contains_pii equals False, standard behavior for POL-PRIVACY-016 shall be overridden.
