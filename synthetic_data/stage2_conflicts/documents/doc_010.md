# Stage 2 synthetic document 10

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.

Agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt and the number of days since purchase is less than or equal to 14; however, if physical damage is present, agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-010, designated as department priority, agents shall offer a refund to customers when the customer has a valid receipt (has_receipt equals True) and the purchase was made within twenty-one days or fewer (days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 21); however, notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, agents shall deny the refund if the item exhibits physical damage (physical_damage equals True).

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-004, designated as regulatory priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within seven days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 7); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-004 (regulatory priority), agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within seven days (days_since_purchase <= 7); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), standard Policy POL-RETURNS-004 behavior shall be overridden.
