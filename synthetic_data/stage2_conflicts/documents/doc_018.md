Under Policy POL-REFUND-005 (company priority), agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 14 days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if the item shows physical damage (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), a delay in shipping is permitted (allow_delay).

Policy POL-SHIP-008 (regulatory priority) states that when item_in_stock == True, agents must ship_within_48h; however, if severe_weather_alert == True, then allow_delay shall apply as an exception to the 48-hour shipping requirement. As a low-priority department exception, when item_in_stock == False, standard behavior for POL-SHIP-008 shall be overridden.

Under Policy POL-PRIVACY-001, designated as company priority, when any data or information contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii equals True), agents shall be required to disclose the presence of such personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-004, designated as regulatory priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within seven days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 7); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

Under Policy POL-RETURNS-004 (regulatory priority), agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within seven days (days_since_purchase <= 7); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), standard Policy POL-RETURNS-004 behavior shall be overridden.
