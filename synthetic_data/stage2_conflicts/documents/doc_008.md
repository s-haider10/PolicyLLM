Under Policy POL-RETURNS-009, designated as company priority, agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within fourteen days or fewer (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

When a refund amount is greater than or equal to 400, agents shall be required to verify the identity of the customer, as established under Policy POL-SEC-012 with regulatory priority classification.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-006 establishes that when any data contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii == True), agents shall be required to disclose the presence of such personally identifiable information (disclose_pii), with this policy designated as department priority.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-006 (department priority) establishes the following requirements: When contains_pii equals True, agents must execute disclose_pii; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby when contains_pii equals False, standard behavior for POL-PRIVACY-006 shall be overridden.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), agents are permitted to delay shipment beyond the standard 48-hour requirement.
