Under Policy POL-REFUND-010, designated as department priority, agents shall offer a refund to customers when the customer has a valid receipt (has_receipt equals True) and the purchase was made within twenty-one days or fewer (days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 21); however, notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, agents shall deny the refund if the item exhibits physical damage (physical_damage equals True).

Under Policy POL-REFUND-005 (company priority), agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 14 days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if the item exhibits physical damage (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-005, designated as company priority, agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within fourteen days (days_since_purchase <= 14); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date. As a low-priority department exception, when the customer does not have a receipt (has_receipt == False), standard Policy POL-REFUND-005 behavior shall be overridden.
