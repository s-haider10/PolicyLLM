Under Policy POL-SHIP-013, designated as company priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when the item is in stock (item_in_stock == True); however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when a severe weather alert is in effect (severe_weather_alert == True).

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), a delay in shipping is permitted (allow_delay).

Policy POL-SHIP-008 (regulatory priority) stipulates that when item_in_stock == True, agents must ship_within_48h; however, if severe_weather_alert == True, then allow_delay is permitted as an exception to the standard shipping timeframe. Additionally, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if item_in_stock == False, standard behavior for POL-SHIP-008 shall be overridden.

When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Policy POL-SEC-002 (department priority) mandates that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-002 shall be overridden.

Under Policy POL-REFUND-015 (situational priority), agents must offer a refund to customers when has_receipt equals True and days_since_purchase is less than or equal to 28 days; however, if physical_damage equals True, agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase timeframe.
