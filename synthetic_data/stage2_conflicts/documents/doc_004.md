When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-017, which is designated as company priority, agents must verify the customer's identity if the refund amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Policy POL-PRIVACY-016 (regulatory priority) states that when data contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii equals True), agents shall be required to disclose the presence of personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

Agents must offer a refund to customers when the customer has a receipt and the purchase was made within 14 days; however, if physical damage is present, agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or days since purchase.

When an item is in stock (item_in_stock == True), agents must ship the item within 48 hours (ship_within_48h); however, if a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True), a delay in shipping is permitted (allow_delay).
