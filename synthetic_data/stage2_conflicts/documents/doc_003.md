Under Policy POL-RETURNS-014 (department priority), agents must offer a refund when the customer has a receipt (has_receipt == True) and the purchase was made within 21 days (days_since_purchase <= 21); however, if physical damage is present (physical_damage == True), agents must deny the refund regardless of receipt status or purchase date.

Under Policy POL-SHIP-013, designated as company priority, agents must ship items within 48 hours when the item is in stock (item_in_stock == True); however, an exception applies whereby delays are permitted when a severe weather alert is active (severe_weather_alert == True).

Policy POL-PRIVACY-006 (department priority) mandates that if any data contains personally identifiable information (contains_pii == True), agents must disclose the presence of such personally identifiable information (disclose_pii).

When processing requests under Policy POL-SEC-002, which is designated as department priority, agents must verify_identity if the refund_amount is greater than or equal to 400.

Policy POL-SEC-002 (department priority) mandates that agents must verify_identity when refund_amount >= 400; however, a low-priority department exception applies whereby if refund_amount <= 400, standard behavior for POL-SEC-002 shall be overridden.
